## Having Git Commit Issues for the first time?
(1) Git init in your folder <br />
(2) Do whatever work you need to do locally <br />
(3) On Github.com -> make a repo and grab the link .git that is generated <br />
(4) See below to run in terminal (while in your repo folder) <br />
  // stage all your changes <br />
  ```bash
  git add . 
  ```

  // commits them to your local repository with a message
  ```bash
  git commit -m "This change has been made"
  ```

  // add remote url
  ```bash
  git remote add origin https://github.com/example-user/example-repo.git
  ```

  // pushes the changes you have committed to master branch
  // this one may not work for you, but just do what your terminal tells you to do then
  ```bash
  git push -u
  ```

  // if you want to update your local files from the repo here
  ```bash
  git pull origin master
  ```
