## Having Git Commit Issues for the first time?
(1) Git init in your folder
(2) Do whatever work you need to do locally
(3) On Github.com -> make a repo and grab the link .git that is generated
(4) See below to run in terminal (while in your repo folder)
  //stage all your changes
  git add .
  
  //commits them to your local repository with a message
  git commit -m "This change has been made"
  
  //add remote url
  git remote add origin https://github.com/example-user/example-repo.git
  
  //pushes the changes you have committed to master branch
  // this one may not work for you, but just do what your terminal tells you to do then
  git push -u
